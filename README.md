# vanilla complete

This is an introductory course on vanilly javascript from scratch. We are going to build everything for a single page application from scratch. We are going to create an empty folder in our dev folder where we store our javascript projects and we are going to name i vanilla-complet. We are starting with our README.md file. Next we are going to generate our project using this line:

```js
npm init -y
```

Now we have our starting point. Before we link up to github, let's create out .gitignore file and we can do so by typing this code:

```js
npx gitignore node
```

Now let's create a repo on github and link everything up.

```js
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

Then just copy the git remote line that github provides you. It will look something like this:

```js
git remote add origin https://github.com/C5m7b4/vanilla-complete.git
```

And then finally we need to run this line in our bash:

```js
git push -u origin master
```
