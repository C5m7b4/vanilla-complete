# vanilla complete

This is an introductory course on vanilly javascript from scratch. We are going to build everything for a single page application from scratch. We are going to create an empty folder in our dev folder where we store our javascript projects and we are going to name i vanilla-complet. We are starting with our README.md file. Next we are going to generate our project using this line:

```js
npm init -y
```

Now we have our starting point. Before we link up to github, let's create out .gitignore file and we can do so by typing this code:

```js
npx gitignore node
```

Now let's create a repo on github and link everything up.
